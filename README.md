## Highlights

- **GPU-accelerated spectrum & waterfall** — QRhi rendering on the GPU (OpenGL/Metal/D3D11), ~71% CPU reduction over CPU paint, GPU-composited slice flags, and multi-GPU adapter selection
- **Multi-slice & multi-panadapter** — colour-coded VFO overlays, independent TX assignment, diversity/ESC beamforming; up to 8 detachable pans with native VITA-49 waterfall tiles, with selectable S-meter / **SmartMTR** meter views per flag
- **KiwiSDR public-receiver browser** — find and connect to public KiwiSDR receivers worldwide through an API-policy-aware directory (diversity receive with receive-only TX inhibit)
- **Aetherial Audio Channel Strip** — a unified RX **and** TX DSP suite (gate, EQ, compressor, de-esser, tube, AetherVoice exciter, reverb, brickwall limiter) with a preset library and a per-side scope
- **Six client-side noise-reduction engines** — NR2 (spectral), RN2 (RNNoise), NR4 (libspecbleach), DFNR (DeepFilterNet3), BNR (NVIDIA GPU AI), and MNR (macOS)
- **DAX virtual audio + IQ** — 4 RX + 1 TX channels and raw I/Q at 24–192 kHz for WSJT-X / fldigi / VARA / JS8Call, plus a per-slice **WFM demodulator** for satellite data
- **AetherModem packet radio** — KISS-over-TCP TNC, connected-mode AX.25 BBS, a personal mailbox, and an **APRS client** (station map, GPS beacon, messaging) with a Direwolf-derived VHF demodulator
- **AetherSweep** — in-panadapter SWR analyzer with log scale, threshold-band shading, and interpolated bandwidth at SWR ≤ 1.5 / 2.0
- **SpotHub** — DX Cluster, RBN, WSJT-X, POTA, and FreeDV Reporter spots with auto-mode switch
- **CW operator suite** — real-time Morse decoder, MIDI/keyboard straight-key & iambic paddles with full QSK, optional Quindar tones
- **FreeDV RADE** — AI digital-voice codec with a client-side neural encoder/decoder
- **SmartLink remote + TCI v2.0 server** — Auth0/TLS WAN operation, and CAT + audio + IQ + CW + spots over a single TCI WebSocket
- **Broad hardware control** — rigctld + virtual-serial CAT, MIDI mapping, the FlexControl knob, serial PTT/CW keying, and Multi-Flex operation alongside SmartSDR/Maestro

## How AetherSDR Is Built

AetherSDR is developed using an AI-augmented open-source workflow:

- **Project lead (Jeremy KK7GWY) + a core contributor team** working primarily through Claude Code and a mix of AI development tools — every commit goes through the merge gate; nothing reaches `main` without human review
- **[AetherClaude](https://github.com/aethersdr/aetherclaude) orchestrator bot** auto-triages incoming issues, drafts implementation plans, and produces PRs for issues labelled `aetherclaude-eligible`
- **Contributors use a mix of AI tools** (Codex, Copilot, Cursor, Gemini, Aider) — the project's [Constitution](CONSTITUTION.md) (14 principles, structured per [Cisco's Foundry Constitution](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/foundry-security-spec) spec) codifies the conventions every contributor and every AI tool follows
- **Branch protection enforces signed commits, CI green, and CODEOWNERS review** — every change goes through the same gate regardless of which AI tool (or human) produced it
- **At active pace: ~50 PRs per week, ~15,000–30,000 lifetime downloads, ≥6 distinct AI tools touching the codebase**

See [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for the canonical project guide that every AI assistant reads first, and [`CONSTITUTION.md`](CONSTITUTION.md) for the principles that gate the contribution model.

Active test target is FLEX-8600 firmware 4.2.18 (SmartSDR protocol v1.4.0.0);
earlier 4.x firmware works; v3.x is unsupported.

MIDI, Stream Deck/StreamController plugins, and generic USB-serial adapters:

- FlexRadio FlexControl USB tuning knob
- Icom RC-28 USB remote encoder
- Griffin PowerMate USB knob
- Contour ShuttleXpress and ShuttlePro v2 jog controllers
- MIDI controllers with learn mode, profiles, and relative-encoder support
- Elgato Stream Deck devices through the bundled macOS/Windows Stream Deck plugin
- Stream Deck devices on Linux through the bundled StreamController plugin
- USB-serial PTT/CW interfaces for foot switches, straight keys, iambic paddles,
  amplifier keying lines, and external sequencers

## Building from Source

### Dependencies

Install all dependencies for a full-featured build. Optional packages are noted — the build succeeds without them but the corresponding features are disabled.

```bash
# Arch / CachyOS / Manjaro

  qt6-shadertools cmake ninja pkgconf autoconf automake libtool \

<details>
<summary>What each dependency enables</summary>

| Package | Feature |
|---------|---------|
| qt6-base, qt6-multimedia | Core application (required) |
| qt6-base-private-dev | GPU-accelerated spectrum/waterfall (QRhi) |
| qt6-shadertools-dev | GPU shader compilation |
| qt6-websockets-dev | TCI server, FreeDV Reporter spots |
| qt6-serialport-dev | FlexControl, serial PTT/CW, MIDI controllers |
| libfftw3-dev | NR2 spectral noise reduction |

</details>

> **Linux Mint / Ubuntu note:** If PC audio devices show as "Dummy Output",
> install `gstreamer1.0-pulseaudio`. For PipeWire systems, also install `gstreamer1.0-pipewire`.
>
> **Ubuntu 26.04 note:** If AetherSDR fails to start with a missing
> `libOpenGL.so.0` error, install `libopengl0`.  26.04 stopped pulling it in
> by default for the desktop image; the build-deps line above includes it
> explicitly so this only bites users who install just the AppImage.

### Build & Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aethersdr/AetherSDR.git
cd AetherSDR
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
./build/AetherSDR
```

RADE-enabled builds use a vendored Opus snapshot, so no additional Opus download
is required during configure or build.

### Qt 6.7+ for GPU Spectrum Rendering

GPU-accelerated spectrum/waterfall rendering requires Qt 6.7 or greater. If your distribution ships with an older version (e.g., Ubuntu 24.04, Debian 12, or Mint 21–22 include Qt 6.4.2), the build system automatically disables GPU rendering and falls back to the CPU-based `QPainter` path. (Release binaries ship Qt 6.8.3 LTS; the 6.7 floor is the source-build minimum for QRhi.)

To use GPU acceleration on these systems, install Qt 6.7+ manually:

1. **Option 1: Using a PPA (Ubuntu/Mint)**
   The `kubuntu-backports` PPA may provide a newer Qt — verify the version it ships before relying on it.

2. **Option 2: Using the Qt Online Installer**
   Install Qt into your home directory (e.g., `~/Qt/6.8.3/gcc_64`). Because CMake otherwise defaults to the system-provided Qt, point it at the newer install with `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`:

   ```bash
   cmake -B build -G Ninja \
       -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$HOME/Qt/6.8.3/gcc_64" \
       -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
   ```

   Make sure the `qtshadertools` and `qt5compat` (or equivalent) modules are selected in the Qt Online Installer along with `qtbase`.

*Note: GPU rendering also needs the private QtGui headers (`qt6-base-private-dev` on Debian-family, included by default in the Qt Online Installer).*

### Install (optional, Linux)

```bash
sudo cmake --install build
```
